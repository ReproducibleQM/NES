The data for Working Paper 477 currently sits as _photo-copy scans_ in the following pdf: http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100PAGW.TXT

The data for Working Paper 476 currently sits as _photo-copy scans_ in the following pdf: https://www.owrb.ok.gov/quality/standards/pdf_standards/scenicrivers/WP476-NationalEutrophicationSurvey.PDF

I (@jsta) have written some code to extract the data from the pdf using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The code is at: https://github.com/jsta/nesR. It is not perfect. Some characters are not correctly identified, each page takes a couple minutes and is a big computation load on my machine.
