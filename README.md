## Data

The data pdfs are available by searching: https://www.epa.gov/nscep

They are mirrored at: https://github.com/jsta/nesR/tree/master/inst/extdata

## Notes
I (@jsta) have written some code to extract the data from the pdf using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The code is at: https://github.com/jsta/nesR. It is not perfect. Some characters are not correctly identified, each page takes a couple minutes and is a big computation load on my machine. 

# Change made on Ryan's system
# And now an Rstudio change!!
